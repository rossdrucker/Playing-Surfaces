# Playing-Surfaces

This repository contains code necessary to draw scale versions of playing surfaces to visualize play-by-play data for NHL, MLB, NBA, NFL, and NCAA basketball games. Not all leagues make positional data publicly available, but these will serve as good starting points for manual collection.

Code is written by Ross Drucker in R and Python.

League logos are provided in the `League Logos` folder in each subfolder, but are only hard-coded into the R files.
