    ----------
    center: The (x, y) coordinates of the center of the circle. Default: (0, 0)
    npoints: The number of points with which to create the circle. This will

    d: Diameter of the circle IN THE UNITS OF THE PLOT. This default unit will
        be feet. Default: 2 (unit circle)
    start: The angle (in radians) at which to start drawing the circle, where
